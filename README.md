COVID-19 (2019-nCOV / SARS-CoV-2) Coronavirus Map (https://sharp-meitner-3f4b66.netlify.com) is an interactive, animated map for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

The map is based on multiple sources (see below for details). If you are interested, the integrated dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/pkjha1/covid19/blob/master/public/data/all.json). Note that numbers in different data sources may not match with each other exactly.

Pull requests are welcome. If you'd like to support the work and buy me a ☕, I greatly appreciate it!
